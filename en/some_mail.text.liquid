Hello, {{name}}!

You probably received a letter asking you to pay for {{domain}} store maintenance recently.

We apologize for this "happiness" newsletter on the weekend. In fact, you do not need to pay anything. You had a free period.

Unfortunately, it happens that programmers were in a hurry to post a new release and launched an untested newsletter.

We perfectly understand how you felt. Most of our friends and acquaintances whom we asked to test our service received similar SMS.

Sorry again. You need to pay nothing.

Have a nice day!

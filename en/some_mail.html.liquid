Hello, {{name}}!
<br>
You probably received a letter asking you to pay for {{domain}} store maintenance recently.
<br>
We apologize for this "happiness" newsletter on the weekend. In fact, you do not need to pay anything. You had a free period.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, it happens that programmers were in a hurry to post a new release and launched an untested newsletter.
<br><br>
We perfectly understand how you felt. Most of our friends and acquaintances whom we asked to test our service received similar SMS.
<br><br>
Sorry again. You need to pay nothing.
<br><br>
Have a nice day!
